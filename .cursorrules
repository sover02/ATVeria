# Cursor Rules for ATVeria (Arcade ATV Prototype Phase)

## General Goals
- Build an arcade-style 3D ATV driving game in Unity.
- Player is a sentient ATV in a stylized open world.
- Focus first on getting the *feel* of driving: jumping, drifting, turning, and speed.
- No premade tricks or combat yet.

## Engine & Tooling
- Unity (2022 LTS) using URP on macOS.
- C# scripts organized by function (Player, Systems, etc.)
- Using Unity physics (Rigidbody + WheelCollider).
- Input handled via Unity Input System or legacy Input.

## Current Focus Areas
- ATV movement: forward, reverse, turn, brake
- Jumping off terrain using physics
- Camera follow system
- Core test scene with terrain and ramps

## Guidelines for Agents
- Separate input and physics logic into distinct scripts
- Use Rigidbody and WheelColliders for realism
- Use Physics Materials (low friction) for drifting
- Avoid premature optimization
- Visuals can be Unity cubes and cylinders
